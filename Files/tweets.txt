@notleavinglv @RICK1836 @NVTaraStrange @POTUS Also, we do not have a centralized economy like communist countries do. The US government does not make baby formula nor is it in charge of baby formula production. We should, however, use antitrust law to enlarge the # of suppliers. 4 suppliers control 90% of the supply.
